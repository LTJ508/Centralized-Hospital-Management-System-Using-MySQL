# Idea of this project belongs to: Sazid Hasan Shafin
Thanks for this idea, which was not available on the online sites.

## To run this project:
<br>01. Create a Database by the name of "chms"

<br>02. Import the SQL file name "chms.sql"

<br>03. Extract the Zip File name "CHMS" and place it in the htdocs folder of XAMPP.

<br>04. Make sure that there is only one folder by the name "CHMS" after the extract.
	<br>After extraction, there can be two folders, one inside another.
	<br>Simply cut the inside one and paste it into the "htdocs" folder.
	<br>A Snapshot of the folder with location is also provided by the name of "Folder View"

<br>05. After that, enable phpMyAdmin and MySQL from the XAMPP App and visit the link
	<br>"http://localhost/chms/"

<br>06. "Site Map.png" contains a short map of our project sites.

<br>07. We have also provided an online link to the sitemap in the text file named "Site Map.txt"

<br>08. And a Scema Diagram provided which is generated from the database
